Python Introduction

Python Input Output (I/O) Using input() and print() Function

A good program should effectively communicate any input in Python from the user and display a result to the outside world. A user can give a program input manually from a keyboard or use data from an external source, such as a file or a database. Python offers us several built-in functions that make it easy to create a program quickly. Two of the most commonly used built-in functions are the input() and print() functions that are used for frequent input and output operations, respectively.
